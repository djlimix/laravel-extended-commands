# Laravel Extended Commands

This is a simple package used to add more `make:*` commands.

Right now, it adds these commands:
- make:interface
- make:service
- make:trait

All files generated by the commands are stored in `App/Type`, so for example, trait files are stored in `App/Traits` with the same namespace.

## Installation
You should install this as a dev dependency:
```
composer require djlimix/laravel-extended-commands --dev
```

## Command structure
### Making an interface
```
php artisan make:interface InterfaceName
```
This generates a file called `InterfaceName.php` with the namespace of `App\Interfaces` inside the folder `app\Interfaces`.

### Making a service
```
php artisan make:service ServiceName
```
This generates a file called `ServiceName.php` with the namespace of `App\Services` inside the folder `app\Services`.

### Making a trait
```
php artisan make:trait TraitName
```
This generates a file called `TraitName.php` with the namespace of `App\Traits` inside the folder `app\Traits`.

Using a slash in the name of interface/service/trait creates the file in a subfolder, **for example**:
`php artisan make:trait User/CreateUserTrait` creates a trait named `CreateUserTrail` inside the folder `app\Traits\User` with the namespace of `app\Traits\User`

## Requirements
This package requires Laravel 8 or higher.
